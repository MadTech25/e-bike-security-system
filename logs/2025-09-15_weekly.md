# QED / Rich Customs — Weekly Log
**Week of Sept 15–19, 2025**

## Sept 15 (Monday)
- Ultrasonic sensors: spacing issue. Fixed holes in Fusion; opened holes with dry solder heat. Fit is tight, slightly stresses board.
- LEDs: orientation conflicted with ultrasonic board. Repositioned; direction to be handled in software.
- Signal box face: completed and fitted.
- Carcass: bottom holes aligned with lid bosses; print in progress (~7–8 hrs) for strength/fit.
- Research: LED tail lights for battery integration.
- Ignition: controller ignition wire chosen for startup/lock-in/lock-out.

## Sept 17 (Wednesday)
- Control box hinge: switched to Tinkercad for simpler design. First hinge proto visually OK, mechanically unusable. Likely plastic body + metal pin.
- Printing: hinge proto running; photos taken.
- Bike: wheel secured at Puyallup shop. Met Brett (owner) → potential partner.
- Hardware: plan store run for signal box hardware.
- Mounts: bracket ideas for headlight; tail light may mount to signal box.
- Branding: tentative focus next day.

## Sept 18 (Thursday)
- Launch prep: product tiers for alarm/anti-theft.
  - **Basic:** alarm, buzzer, LED, tamper sensor, display.
  - **Mid:** alarm, tilt sensor, flashing LED, turn signals, RFID *or* keypad.
  - **Deluxe:** alarm, tilt sensor, flashing LED, turn signals, RFID + keypad.
  - **Add-on:** ultrasonic for vehicle detection.
- Plan: one hybrid board supports all tiers; upgrades by wiring/software.
- Next QED: build circuit for alarm + signals + display; design case; integrate.

## Sept 19 (Friday)
- Hinge proto shattered on removal. Looks good, not functional.
- New approach: center hole + thick wire/pin as hinge axis.
- Week close: hinge unresolved; redesign pending.

## Weekly Summary
- Signal box: face done; carcass print underway; internal fit adjusted.
- Hinge: failures confirm need for metal pin design.
- Alarm system: tiers defined; hybrid board confirmed.
- Networking: local shop contact secured.
